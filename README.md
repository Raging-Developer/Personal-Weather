# Personal-Weather
Local Weather App

In January 2019 Yahoo! closed down their yql query database. 
This query made it possible to get the WOEID from the location provided by the GPS of the device. 
Currently there is no way of changing the GPS location to a format that can be used by the Yahoo! weather API.

UPDATE:
Yahoo now allows lat long as a parameter. 
However it does insist on using its own implemtation of OAuth, which I have not figured out yet.

I will do it when I get the time, until then, this code does not work.
