# Personal-Weather
Local Weather App

In January 2019 Yahoo! closed down their yql query database. 
This query made it possible to get the WOEID from the location provided by the GPS of the device. 
Currently there is no way of changing the GPS location to a format that can be used by the Yahoo! weather API.
This means a rewrite with a new api provider. 
Since the layout is quite deeply coupled to the json reponse this is not a trivial piece of work.

I will do it when I get the time, until then, this code does not work.
